      ## Introduction

      Ready to implement user account verification in your application? Here's how it works at a high level:

      1. The users begin the registration process by entering their data, including a phone number, into a signup form

      1. The authentication system sends a one-time password to the user's mobile phone to verify the possession of that phone number

      1. The user enters the one-time password into a form before completing registration

      1. The user opens a success page and receives an SMS indicating that his/her account has been created

      ## Building Blocks

      To get this done, you'll be working with the following Twilio-powered APIs:

      **Authy REST API**

      * [Authy Docs](//docs.authy.com/): Find quick starts, documentation, and all about the helper libraries.

      **Twilio REST API**

      * [Messages Resource](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages): We
      will use Twilio directly to send our user a confirmation message after they
      create an account.

      Let's get started! Click the right arrow to move on to the next step of the tutorial.

  .step(data-title='User Model', data-file='AccountVerification.Web/Models/IdentityModels.cs' data-highlight="13-19")
    :markdown
      ## The User Model

      The User Model for this use-case is pretty straight-forward. If you have already read
      through the [2FA tutorial](//www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/two-factor-authentication/csharp/MVC) this one probably looks very similar.

  .step(data-title='New User Form', data-file='AccountVerification.Web/Controllers/AccountController.cs', data-highlight='152-191')
    :markdown
      ## New User Form

      When we create a new user, we ask for a name, e-mail address, and a password.
      In order to validate their account we also ask them for a mobile number
      with a country code. We use Authy to send them a one-time password via SMS
      to this phone number.

      It is now the controller's responsibility to verify that the user provides
      the necessary information to create a new user. If the user is created successfully,
      he/she will be logged into the system automatically.

      Now the user is logged in but not verified. In the next steps we'll
      learn how to verify the user using Authy.

  .step(data-title='Authy Configuration' data-file='AccountVerification.Web/Web.config' data-highlight="19-22" data-mode='xml')
    :markdown
      ## Authy Configuration

      Before we move on let's take a quick look at some application configuration.

      You need to create a Local.config file under the `AccountVerification.Web` directory with the following content:
      ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <appSettings>
          <add key="TwilioAccountSID" value="your_twilio_account_SID" />
          <add key="TwilioAuthToken" value="your_twilio_auth_token" />
          <add key="TwilioNumber" value="your_twilio_number" />
          <add key="AuthyKey" value="your_authy_key" />
        </appSettings>
      ```

      Now we need our Authy production key ([sign up for Authy
      here](https://dashboard.authy.com/signup)). When you create an Authy
      application the production key is found on the dashboard.

      ![Authy Dashboard](//s3.amazonaws.com/howtodocs/2fa-authy-dashboard.png)

      Next we need to jump over to the `UserController` to configure the Authy
      client and create an instance method to send a one-time password.

    :markdown
      ## Sending a Token on Account Creation

      Once the user has an `authyId` we can actually send a verification code
      to that user's mobile phone.

      When our user is created successfully, via the form we implemented, we send
      a token to the user's mobile phone to verify their account in our
      controller. When the code is sent we redirect to another page where the
      user can enter the token they received, therefore completing the verification process.

      Let's check out the code for that next!

  .step(data-title='Verifying the Code', data-file='AccountVerification.Web/App_Start/IdentityConfig.cs', data-highlight='118-129')
    :markdown
      ## Verifying the Code

      Authy provides us with a `VerifyToken()` method that allows us to pass a
      user id and a token. In this case we just need to check that the API request
      was successful and if so, it calls `setPhoneNumberConfirmedAsync` passing true.

      That's all for token verification! However, our verification form wouldn't be very
      usable if there wasn't a way to resend a verification code if the message
      didn't arrive at the end user's handset.

  .step(data-title='Re-sending The Code', data-file='AccountVerification.Web/Controllers/AccountController.cs', data-highlight='121-142')
    :markdown
      ## Re-sending the Code

      Since the form for re-sending the code is one line see the
      [Verification form](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/account-verification-csharp/blob/master/AccountVerification.Web/Views/Account/ResendVerificationCode.cshtml).
      We're going to skip that for this tutorial. Let's just look at the controller function.

      This controller loads the model associated with the request and then
      uses the same Authy API method we used earlier to resend the code.

      To wrap things up, let's implement the last step where we confirm that the
      user's account has been verified with a text message and a success page.

  .step(data-title="Show User Details Page", data-file='AccountVerification.Web/Views/Account/Status.cshtml')
    :markdown
      ## Show User Details Page

      This simple `cshtml` file displays a user name and let's them know
      they've been verified.

      This should suffice for confirmation in the browser that the user has been
      verified. Let's see how we might send that text message next.

  .step(data-title='Sending the Confirmation Message', data-file='AccountVerification.Web/App_Start/IdentityConfig.cs', data-highlight='21-28')
    :markdown
      ## Sending the Confirmation Message

      We create a single instance of the Twilio REST API helper,
      called `twilio` in this example.

      Then all we need to do to send an SMS to the user's phone is use the built
      in `SendMessage()`.
